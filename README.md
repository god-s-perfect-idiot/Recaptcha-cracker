# Recaptcha-cracker
WIP. My 14q cs0019tu doesn't support AVX or CUDA. So, i have to give up on running TensorFlow on it. Let me try my 15ay 503tx. 

tx seems to have AVX2 support. I got way ahead as of now. Only problem; i dont think Keras is strong enough to process images as grainy as recaptcha samples. I need a better model. And some good preprocessing.
